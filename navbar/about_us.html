        West Pioneer Properties (India) Pvt. Ltd. (WPPIPL) is a leading
        retail-led mixed use developer and operator of high-quality consumer
        shopping malls along with residential and commercial developments in
        India.

      <p style="color: #666; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.5">
        The company's pioneering spirit is very evident in its vision of seeing
        possibilities for future growth and development, and turning them into
        on-ground success stories. This has seen it zero in on and acquire vast
        tracts of land in strategic locations in Tier II cities in western and
        southern parts of the country; the engines of potentially enormous
        growth in the near future. These land holdings form the basis of
        developments to cater to the burgeoning demands of a rapidly modernising
        society. Based on the potential of specific sites and their strategic
        location advantages, West Pioneer Properties will undertake the
        development of shopping malls and entertainment hubs, commercial
        complexes, mall cum hotel complexes as well as premium residential
        projects. In true pioneering spirit, each development is marked by the
        foresight of anticipating the needs of the populace well in advance, and
        making the most of the first-mover's advantage. Having already tasted
        success with its first few projects, the company is poised to grow from
        strength to strength.F.
